# Simple shell

## Introduction
Inspired by the behavior of Unix shells like bash or sh, this project aims to understand and replicate the fundamental behavior of a shell: reading user commands, interpreting them, and executing the corresponding programs.

## Usage

```c
#include "shell.h"

void display_usage(void)
{
	printf("Usage: ./my_shell\n");
	printf("A minimal Unix-like shell that reads and executes commands.\n\n");

	printf("Built-in commands:\n");
	printf("  exit : Exit the shell\n");
	printf("  env  : Print the environment variables\n\n");

	printf("Supported external commands (via PATH):\n");
	printf("  ls   : List directory contents (e.g., /bin/ls)\n");
	printf("  All other commands found in your PATH are also supported\n");
}
```

## Features

- Custom shell prompt waiting for user commands
- Support for built-in commands:
  - `exit` : exits the shell
  - `env` : displays environment variables
- Execution of external commands using the `PATH`
- Error handling with custom error messages
- Line-by-line input handling (both interactive and non-interactive mode)
- Graceful exit on `Ctrl+D` (EOF)

## Technical requirements and constraints
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
Your shell should not have any memory leaks
No more than 5 functions per file
All your header files should be include guarded
Use system calls only when you need to (why?)

## Checks 
The Checker will be released at the end of the project (1-2 days before the deadline). We strongly encourage the entire class to work together to create a suite of checks covering both regular tests and edge cases for each task. See task 8. Test suite.

After the deadline, you will need to fork the repository if itâ€™s not on your Github account to be able to be corrected by the checker.


## Example

```bash
$ ./simple_shell
$ ls
file1.c  main.c  shell.h
$ env
USER=yourname
PATH=/usr/bin:/bin
$ exit

But also in non-interactive mode:

julien@ubuntu:/# echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
julien@ubuntu:/# cat test_ls_2
/bin/ls
/bin/ls
julien@ubuntu:/# cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
julien@ubuntu:/#

## Flowchart
## Man Page

## Explanation of files

###main.c
Entry point of the shell. Contains the main loop that handles user input.

###path.c
This file contains functions responsible for locating the full path of a command using the PATH environment variable.

###aux.c
This file contains helper functions used throughout the shell project to keep the code clean and modular.

###display_prompt.c
This file contains the function responsible for displaying the shell prompt to the user.

###execute_command.c
This file contains the core logic to process and execute commands entered by the user.

###execute_in_child.c
This file handles the execution of external commands in a child process.

###handle_builtin.c
This file manages built-in commands supported by the shell, such as exit and env.

###read_input.c
This file handles user input reading from the terminal.

###tokenize.c
This file is responsible for splitting user input into separate tokens (command and arguments).

##Compilation
To compile simple shell use:
```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
```
